%- HL upgrades for the LHC \\
%- FCC-hh, 100 TeV hadronic collider at the stage of CDR \\
%- Feasibility studies/previous work on this channel (slightly longer literature review)\\

The searches performed so far for di-Higgs production covered different decay channels and targeted not only the SM production but also some BSM scenarios where this process is enhanced. Neither could achieve enough statistical significance to declare the observation of this process nor found any deviation from the SM predictions. 

The most stringent limit comes from a combination of searches using up to $36.1~\text{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at a center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. The combination is performed using the analysis searching for $hh\rightarrow b\overline{b}b\overline{b}$, $hh\rightarrow b\overline{b}\tau^+\tau^.$ and $hh\rightarrow b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma$. The combined observed (expected) limit on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair cross-section is $0.22$ pb ($0.35$ pb) at $95\%$ confidence level, which corresponds to $6.7 (10.4)$ times the predicted SM cross-section. The ratio of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its SM expectation ($k_{\lambda}=\lambda_{hhh}/\lambda_{hhh}^{SM}$) is observed (expected) to be contrained at $95\%$ CL to $-5.0<k_{\lambda}<12.1 (-5.8<k_{\lambda}<12.0)$.

Monte Carlo studies assessing the feasibility of searches for di-Higgs production at the High Luminosity LHC and at the FCC-hh have been performed. [REPRESENTATIVE STUDIES AND REFS]

Studies on the impact of the granularity of the calorimeters in the spatial resolving power of hadronic showers and on the resolution of jet mass and substructure variables greatly influenced the baseline design of the FCC-hh. For two Kaons with an energy of 100 GeV each and with a truth level separation equal to $0.035$ it is shown that for a segmentatin of $\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.022\times0.022$ both particles can be resolved in the HCAL [REF].
