\begin{abstract}

This article presents a feasibility study targeting the search for Higgs pairs in the $hh\rightarrow b\overline{b}b\overline{b}$ channel at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV at a future hadronic circular collider, considering a high integrate luminosity. For Standard Model production of Higgs pairs, the achieved significance with a simple cut-based boosted analysis is $S/\sqrt{B}=8.8\pm 1.6~\text{(stat.)}~^{+4.4}_{-3.4}~\text{(sys.)}$. The change in the significance as a function of the granularity of the hadronic calorimeter is studied, targeting the optimization of the design of future detectors.
